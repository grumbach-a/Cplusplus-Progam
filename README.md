# Cplusplus-Progam
This project is a console-based C++ application designed to demonstrate how compound interest and regular contributions affect long-term investment growth. Developed for a fictional partner, Airgead Banking, the application is intended as an educational tool for high-school students learning financial literacy concepts.

Users enter an initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and investment duration. The program then generates two reports:

  1. Investment growth without monthly deposits
  2. Investment growth with monthly deposits

Displaying both scenarios side-by-side helps users clearly understand the impact of compound interest and consistent contributions over time.

Key Accomplishments:

  1. Implemented accurate monthly compound interest calculations
  2. Designed clear, readable console reports
  3. Kept main() minimal to improve clarity and maintainability
  4. Resolved real-world multi-file compilation and linker issues in VS Code
  5. Produced output that matches expected financial models and test cases

Technical Highlights:

  1. Nested loops to model monthly compounding within yearly summaries
  2. Modular design using header and implementation files
  3. Clean separation between user input, calculations, and output formatting

Challenges & Solutions:

  The most challenging aspects of this project were implementing monthly compound interest correctly and managing nested loops   while tracking yearly totals. These challenges were addressed by breaking calculations into smaller steps, validating results   against known examples, and testing incrementally.
  Another major challenge involved compiling and linking multiple source files. This was resolved by learning how build paths,   working directories, and compiler arguments interact in a real development environment.

Opportunities for Improvement:

  1. Input validation and error handling
  2. Unit testing for calculation verification

Transferable Skills:

  1. Modular program design
  2. Debugging compiler and linker errors

Translating real-world requirements into working code

  1. Writing readable, maintainable C++
  2. Managing multi-file projects in a professional environment
